# Bank-Test
A project for Intro to Programing which creates and manages a single Bank Account.

Part 1 is the more basic structure of the program, setting up the main program loop with the basic core functionality of the program. 

Part 2 fleshes out Part 1 by adding more information to display in certain methods aswell as input validation through exception handling to make sure the user cannot input an unintended sequence of numbers or letters when not intended.
